Charlie 
=======

Charlie is a digital butler for the NUS Hackers. This document contains
installation instructions, and will be updated concurrently with development.

Installation
------------
The normal Rails rules apply: pull the repository and run bundle. Charlie is set up to run with spork, guard and RSpec. 

The Gemfile includes a few Mac-specific gems: growl and rb-fsevent. Remove these if they cause problems for you. 

This document is still a work in progress.
